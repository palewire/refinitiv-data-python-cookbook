# Importing the library

The [Refinitiv Data Library for Python](https://pypi.org/project/refinitiv-data/) is distributed as a Python package named `refinitiv-data`. To use it, you must first import it into your script.

The import style recommended by Refinitiv is to import it with the alias of `rd`.  Here's how to do it:

```python
import refinitiv.data as rd
```

```{note}
This approach follows a convention popularized by the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis toolkit. It is intended to make your code quicker to type and easier to read.
