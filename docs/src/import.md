# Importing the library

The [LSEG Data Library for Python](https://pypi.org/project/lseg-data/) is distributed as a Python package named `lseg-data`. To use it, you must first import it into your script.

The import style recommended by LSEG is to import it with the alias of `ld`.  Here's how to do it:

```python
import lseg.data as ld
```

```{note}
This approach follows a convention popularized by the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis toolkit. It is intended to make your code quicker to type and easier to read.
